## Course Description

Amazon SageMaker is a solution for developers who want to deploy predictive machine learning models into a production environment. This course teaches you how to set up and configure SageMaker environments, prepare and preprocess datasets, and build, train, and deploy machine learning models using SageMaker's built-in algorithms. Instructor Kesha Williams guides you through evaluating and optimizing model performance, including hyperparameter tuning and performance monitoring, to ensure your models deliver the best results. Additionally, learn best practices for managing costs, implementing security measures, and operationalizing models with MLOps. Whether new to machine learning or looking to expand your AWS skills, this course will provide the hands-on experience and practical knowledge to use Amazon SageMaker in your projects effectively.
